# Purpose

Speech Radar is an Android application that allows users to locate their phone through speech recognition. Suppose for instance an individual must rush to work and is unable to find their phone, but knows itâ€™s located somewhere inside their room. Speech Radar can speed up the search time just by an utterance of a specific word from the individual. Once the phone detects the utterance, it will begin ringing at maximum sound level, which will help the individual locate their phone. The application uses Java, XML and a backend database to achieve this. Python with TensorFlow module is used to train a model for speech recognition, which will be used to make predictions in Speech Radar.
